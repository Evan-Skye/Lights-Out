# Overview 
The lights keep turning off. It's your job to keep them on! Select a light with your cursor. If it's off, turn it on by clicking it with your mouse or touching it on your touch screen. Keep the lights on as long as possible for a High Score. The longer you play, the faster the lights turn off. Good luck!

# Controlling the Menu
The menu is controlled with the Arrow Keys, Enter, & Esc. Enter selects the highlighted option, and Esc exits to the main menu unless you're already there or in-game.

# High Scores
If you achieve a High Score, the game will ask you to input a name. To do so, click on the arrows above or below each letter, and click "Done" when you're finished. Your top 10 scores will be saved even after you close the game!
